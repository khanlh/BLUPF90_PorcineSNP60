## BLUPF90 Porcine SNP60
### Dataset

This repository provides a working example of using BLUPF90 with the public dataset from:

Cleveland, M.A., Hickey, J.M., & Forni, S. (2012). A Common Dataset for Genomic Analysis of Livestock Populations. G3: Genes, Genomes, Genetics, 2(4), 429–435.
https://doi.org/10.1534/g3.111.001453

The dataset (PorcineSNP60) includes:

  - pedigree.txt — pedigree file (ID,SIRE,DAM)
  - phenotypes.txt — five anonymized continuous traits (t1–t5)
  - genotypes.txt — PorcineSNP60 SNP genotypes
  - ebvs.txt — example EBVs and accuracies


    ** Note: Traits t1–t5 are anonymized in the original paper. They are continuous quantitative traits with varying heritability. The exact biological meaning is not disclosed.
